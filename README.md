# ActivityPlanning

This project is a web application for event planning in the IUC SEAS department developed with PHP. 
Its primary purpose is to enable the heads of this department to plan their school events during a 
year with much more precision and rigor. With a well-organized database and well-defined activities,
this application will now be at the heart of planning any SEAS event, focusing on meeting deadlines.
As a result, this report details all the steps that have furnished the implementation of this application
from analysis to maintenance.
